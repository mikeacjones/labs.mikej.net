<h2 is-upgraded>CI/CD is an important piece of achieving a development process that is fast and flexible while remaining reliable.</h2>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>: This is the process of keeping code iterations as small as possible, and integrating them into the main codebase. By keeping our changes small, we can more quickly identify and fix new issues introduced into the codebase, as well as more quickly release stable updates. In this example, you will briefly touch on this process by automating unit testing via the MUnit plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>: This process ties back into continuous integration, and is the concept that our codebase should always remain deliverable. The main codebase should never enter a state which can not be deployed. As part of this process, we automate building and testing, typically via automatic deployment into QA and UAT environments. We will cover this by utilizing the `mule-maven-plugin` to automate deployment into our Sandbox environment.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>: This is typically considered the next and final step in building out an automated pipeline; when a company is utilizing continuous deployment, the release management is tied into an automated process. While we will be taking a simplistic approach, we will touch on this today by creating a protected main branch, which requires that our build and test phases in Sandbox have passed before they can be merged into the master branch, and trigger a deployment to the Production environment.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll build</h2>
<p>In this codelab, you&#39;re going to build a mulesoft API, which you will commit to a new GitHub repository. We will then walk through setting up GitHub Actions to act as our CI/CD platform. Your project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize a git repository for tracking code changes</li>
<li>Automatically execute MUnit suites, requiring all tests to pass before allowing merges into the next branch</li>
<li>Automatically deploy the sandbox branch to the Anypoint sandbox environment in CloudHub</li>
<li>Automatically deploy the master branch to the Anypoint master environment in CloudHub</li>
<li>Utilize the mule-maven-plugin to automate this process, parameterizing various secrets through the GitHub secrets vault</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>How to configure the mule-maven-plugin for deployment to CloudHub, and where to go for documentation covering deployment to other environments</li>
<li>How to configure maven for communication with the Mulesoft Exchange and Nexus repository</li>
<li>How to set up a basic MUnit test suite</li>
<li>How to configure GitHub Actions workflow for maven (this process works very similarly to CircleCI - after going through this project, give configuring CircleCI a try as a self-challenge!)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anypoint platform account for which you have rights to deploy applications, and which you have Environment credentials to; suggest creating a new trial account when doing testing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/signup" target="_blank"><paper-button class="colored" raised>Create Trial Account</paper-button></a></p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub account. Does not need to be a paid account, though you will need to set the repository to public if using a free account.</li>
<li>Credentials to the MuleSoft nexus.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus-ee/content/repositories/releases-ee/" target="_blank"><paper-button class="colored" raised>Test Nexus Access</paper-button></a></p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Access to the Nexus repository is only available to customers with an active MuleSoft subscription. If your organization has an active subscription but does not have access to the Nexus, please open a ticket with support.</p>
<p>You will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to complete this lab without access to the MuleSoft Nexus</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Create Mule Application" duration="0">
        <p>In order to automate mule application testing and deployment, we first have to have an actual application to work with! We will be using the <strong>hello-world </strong>example in Mulesoft&#39;s exchange.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to potential dependency and environment issues, do not use an existing application unless you are confident debugging maven.</p>
